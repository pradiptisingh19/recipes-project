    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Italian chicken marinade is a flavorful blend of ingredients designed to infuse chicken with classic Italian flavors before cooking. This marinade typically includes a combination of herbs, spices, oils, and acids, creating a balance of savory, tangy, and aromatic elements that enhance the taste and tenderness of the chicken. </p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
    </ol>
